# Game Relic Warehouse
My frist rough-draft of a website using HTML

## The Project
As part of the final for our intro to Web-Design class, we had to create our own website using the basics tools and ideas we were taught in class and present it to our peers. I created mine with the idea of an online video game store.

## Layout
I used the layout of a previous project from in class to save some work for myself and rearranged it to fit the mold i had originally created.I used four-column layouts and long with using navigational links in the headers and resizing the whole page for mobile use if neccessary.
